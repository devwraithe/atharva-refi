## Chen's Journey (Supportive Individual)

**Goal:** John stakes SOL to protect tigers in Ranthambore and earns yield while funding real conservation.

### Story

John is scrolling X at lunch when he sees a verified post:

> "Ranthambore Tiger Fund just went live on Atharva ReFi! Stake SOL, earn mSOL yields, and directly protect tigers."

He clicks the link and lands on `atharva.refi` within 2 seconds. A clean, fast-loading homepage greets him with a list of active species pools. At the top:

**"Ranthambore Tiger Conservation"**

- 312 SOL staked
- 6.5% mSOL APY yield
- Population: 79 tigers

### Pool Page Experience

John taps the card. The pool page opens with:

- Tiger and ranger photos
- Verified treasury address
- Detailed stats section
- Prominent **"Support Tigers"** button

### Staking Flow

He clicks "Support Tigers". A sleek modal appears:

- **Input field:** Pre-filled with 4 SOL
- **Clear text:** "You earn full Marinade mSOL yield. 20% of all yield is continuously streamed to Ranthambore's verified wallet - fully on-chain, no middlemen."
- **Live preview:** "4 SOL = 0.26 SOL/year from which 0.052 SOL/year automatically goes straight to Ranthambore Tigers Conservation wallet"

He adjusts to **10 SOL**, hits **"Stake & Protect"**.

Phantom pops up with a single, clearly labeled transaction. He confirms with one tap.

### Confirmation

Eight seconds later, the screen celebrates:

> "Welcome to the pride, John! You are now protecting tigers with 10 SOL."

His **$RMTGR LP tokens** appear instantly:

- In his wallet
- In the Atharva dashboard under "My Impact"

### Dashboard Updates

The dashboard continuously updates:

- His growing mSOL rewards
- The exact amount streamed to Ranthambore (e.g., 0.0021 SOL in the first hour)
- Updated tiger population counter
- Latest ranger field report

### Withdrawal Flow

Weeks later, John decides to withdraw half:

1. Opens the dashboard
2. Selects **"Withdraw"**
3. Chooses 5 SOL
4. Signs one transaction

His **$RMTGR LP tokens** are burned. Principal + earned yield land back in his Phantom wallet within seconds.

John closes the app knowing:

- His capital is safe
- His yield is real
- Every lamport of conservation impact is permanently verifiable on Solana

### Success Metric

John adds the Atharva ReFi dashboard to his homescreen and checks it every morning like a portfolio that also saves tigers.
