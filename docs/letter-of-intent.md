# Letter of Intent – Atharva ReFi Protocol

## What We’re Building

We’re building a protocol that lets users stake SOL into **species-specific conservation pools** (e.g., Ngorongoro Lion Conservation Pool).

Deposited SOL is yield-bearing through liquid staking. A fixed portion of the generated yield is **automatically streamed** to a verified conservation organization’s wallet, while users retain **full control** of their principal at all times.

In return, users receive **pool tokens** (ARFI receipt/LP tokens) representing their proportional share of the pool and ownership stake.

Deposits and withdrawals are **permissionless**, **transparent**, and **on-demand**, allowing contributors to both earn DeFi yields and directly fund real-world conservation efforts for the species they care about.

## Why We’re Building It

Funding for endangered species remains **fragmented**, **opaque**, and largely **trust-based**, making it difficult for supporters to verify real, sustained impact.

This protocol demonstrates how **on-chain systems** can create **continuous**, **transparent**, and **self-sustaining** conservation funding.

By allowing users to stake SOL, earn liquid staking yields (via providers like Marinade Finance), and automatically route a portion of that yield to verified conservation wallets:

- Users retain full ownership and control of their capital
- Conservation organizations receive **predictable**, ongoing funding
- Every contribution and yield stream is **fully verifiable** on-chain

The result: Regenerative conservation finance that is **simple**, **trust-minimized**, and **effective** — proving blockchain can deliver verifiable real-world impact.

## How It’s Built

The protocol is built on **Solana** using the **Anchor** framework for secure, efficient smart contracts.

Key components include:

- **Dedicated staking pools** per species, accepting SOL deposits
- Integration with a **liquid staking provider** (e.g., Marinade Finance) to generate yield on deposited SOL
- **Automatic routing** of a fixed percentage of yield (e.g., 20%) to the verified conservation organization’s wallet
- **Verification mechanism** for conservation wallets: Organizations publish their official wallet address on a verified domain, which is then registered on-chain and linked immutably to the corresponding species pool
- **Pool tokens** (LP/receipt tokens) that represent user ownership, enabling proportional claims, permissionless deposits/withdrawals, and fully transparent accounting

All operations are **non-custodial**, with funds remaining under user control and every flow auditable via Solana Explorer.
