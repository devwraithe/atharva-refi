# Letter of Intent – Atharva ReFi Protocol

## What We're Building

Atharva ReFi Protocol enables transparent, on-chain conservation funding through liquid staking.

Users stake SOL into species-specific pools (e.g., Ranthambore Tiger Conservation). Their SOL generates mSOL yields via Marinade Finance. A fixed portion of yields (20%) automatically streams to verified conservation organizations, while users keep 80% and retain full control of their principal.

Users receive ARFI LP tokens representing their pool ownership. Deposits and withdrawals are permissionless, transparent, and on-demand.

## Why We're Building It

Conservation funding today is fragmented, opaque, and trust-based. Supporters cannot verify impact or track where their money goes.

Atharva ReFi solves this by:

- Generating continuous funding from DeFi yields (not donations)
- Making every transaction verifiable on-chain
- Giving supporters full capital control (withdraw anytime)
- Providing predictable revenue streams for conservation efforts

Result: Regenerative finance that proves blockchain can deliver real-world impact.

## How It's Built

Built on Solana using Anchor framework.

**Core components:**

- Species-specific staking pools accepting SOL deposits
- Marinade Finance integration for liquid staking yields
- Automatic 20% yield routing to verified conservation wallets
- ARFI LP tokens representing proportional pool ownership
- Organization verification through domain-verified wallet registration

**Key principles:**

- Non-custodial (users control their funds)
- Permissionless (deposit/withdraw anytime)
- Transparent (all flows auditable via Solana Explorer)
- Trust-minimized (smart contracts enforce rules)
